# Instructions

Edwin is in charge of the gameboard

the concept of the gameboard is fairly simple; however, I feel that it will turn a lot more complicated as the project progresses. The idea is to copy the Tetromino objects into the 2D array using 1's at the moment. Establish blocks will be labeled as 2 to indicate their state of immovability. You will need to consitently check to see if the block below the tetromino is 2 and decide how to block will behave based on that information.

Josh is in charge of the Tetromino

Make sure that you implement the rotate method and design the tetromino accordingly depending on its constructor string. I feel like there is a lot more but I'm pretty sure the rest is just array work and decision structures

**Your specific instructions are in the files**

We will come across errors obviously. We will discuss those next tuesday. Just try to focus on your individual jobs. This is a test to see how we will plan out our future project.
AND REMEMBER
